# Connecting iOS devices to SmartDust Lab

Step-by-step instructions for connecting iOS devices to the system.

## Step 1: Report Device Information
- Every new iOS device to be connected to the SmartDust Lab must be registered in accordance with Apple requirements.
Contact the Lab system administrator (usually Smartdust) to report the serial number (UDID) of the iOS device you wish to connect.
This step is not necessary for devices that have already been connected to the Lab in the past.

##  Step 2: Resetting the Device

- (Optional) If the device is intended to be used by different users, you might want to first reset it to factory settings to avoid leaking personal data and providing a cleaner experience. 
- **Remove any lockscreen security (passcode, biometric).**

## Step 3: Connecting the Device

1. Turn the provider server on.
2. Connect your iPhone to the server via a USB cable.
3. Unlock the iPhone.
4. Tap **Trust** when prompted by your iPhone.
   - For devices running iOS 17 and above, you will be prompted to trust the computer twice. Ensure to accept the prompt each time it appears.

## Step 4: Verify Connection

- Navigate to the **SmarDust Lab page** to confirm the device connection status.

## Troubleshooting

1. Disconnect the USB cable from your device.
2. Restart your iPhone.
3. Reconnect the USB cable.
